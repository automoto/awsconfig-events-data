# awsconfig-events-data
An open source repository of production like awsconfig events.

The awsconfig events come from an account that creates and destroys infrastructure automatically and sends the awsconfiog notifications to a SQS queue via SNS. The SQS messages and awsconfig events are periodically archived as a JSON array then get uploaded here as a release.
